# Spec 015: Documentation Sync

## 1. Goal
Update `README.md` and `docs/architecture.md` to reflect the latest system state, including Spec 010 (OpenWebUI), Spec 012 (Model Upgrade), Spec 013 (Selective Archiving), and Spec 014 (Content Automation).

## 2. Context
The project has evolved significantly since the initial documentation. Key features like OpenWebUI integration, dynamic model selection, and n8n automation are missing from the main documentation. Additionally, the "Auto Archiving" feature has been changed to "Selective Archiving", which needs to be accurately described to avoid confusion.

## 3. Scope
- `README.md`: Update Features, Usage, and Architecture overview.
- `docs/architecture.md`: Update Layer descriptions and UseCase diagrams.

## 4. Non-Goals
- Code changes impacting logic.
- Major refactoring of documentation structure (just content sync).
